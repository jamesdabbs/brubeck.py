Brubeck is a Django app for creating and exploring a database of topological
information. It features:
- Automated proof generation. Proof visualizations are rendered using the
  JavaScript InfoVis ToolKit.
- Searching for a space by its traits, or a full-text search provided by
  elasticsearch / Bonsai.
- Full revision control of all entered text. Tools for reverting erroneous
  Traits and Implications.
- LaTeX rendering, courtesy of MathJAX.

The best way to get a feel for the site is by clicking around the live instance
running on Heroku.

About
=====
Brubeck is named after Dave Brubeck, a jazz pianist known for his use of
strange, mathematical time signatures.

The code for Brubeck is currently a one-man project, so documentation is a
little sparse in areas that I'm confident future me will understand. If you're
interested in contributing to the project, though, feel free to contact me.
