Possible errors in Counterexamples' table:
- Sierpinski space is fully normal
- Uncountable excluded point topology has a \sigma-locally finite base
- Either-or-topology has a \sigma-locally finite base
- Simplified Arens square is semiregular
- Some extra assumptions needed:
  - Need to assume the Modified Arens space is uncountable for to be ~second countable
  - Need CH for finite complement topology on an uncountable space to be (locally) arc connected
    - Noted in the text, but not in the table
    - In brubeck, we'll define this space to have cardinality c
